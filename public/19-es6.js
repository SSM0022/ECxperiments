/* 
 Let vs. Var:
 With the var keyword you can overwrite variable declarations without an error.
 When using let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.  
 */
var a = 1;
var a = 2; // Overwrites variable
let b = 1;
let b = 2; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared
